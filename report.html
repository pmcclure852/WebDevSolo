<h1>Report: Large Coursework</h1>
<h1>Philip John McClure</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My website is for a fictitious local climbing club in my home town of Warrington. It's purpose is to let potential
new members know about the club give existing members up to date information about meets and hut availability.</p>
<p>I chose a simple structure with a single tier of navigation as I felt that was all that was required for such
a straightforward site. This makes navigation quick and easy for the user as every navigation option is available
immediately at the top of every page.</p>


<h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website</h3>
<ul>
    <li>My love of rock climbing - I have been climbing for over 10 years and love being outdoors in the unique and
    adventurous settings only rock climbing can take you to.</li>
    <li><a href="www.ukclimbing.com">ukclimbing.com</a> - this is the go-to reference for all things climbing in the UK. It
    provided me with inspiration for areas to include in my site.</li>
    <li><a href="www.climbers-club.co.uk">The climbers club</a> website gave me inspiration as to the scope of what
    is possible for a climbing club. They are probably the largest group in the UK with a rich heritage so they were
    a good source of inspiration to look to.</li>
</ul>

<h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Images have alt text.</li>
    <li>My choice of colour provides good contrast for readability.</li>
    <li>Navigation with just the keyboard is possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Navigation of pages is very simple - all options available at the top of every page. Logo returns user to the
        home page.</li>
    <li>Switching through information on pages is simple using back and forward arrows - months on the calendar or meets
        stops at the beginning and end of available data. Switching through the climbing areas loops in a circle.
    </li>
    <li>Layout if clear and responds to resizing of the viewport.</li>
</ul>

<h3>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe
    how you did that</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I had to learn about CSS grid for the layout of the site. I watched videos on youtube by Jen Simmons on her
        channel, Layout Land which I found very useful to get a good overview of the technology. I also used MDN as a
        reference for the syntax. I really enjoyed getting to grips with CSS grid and the responsiveness it allows.</li>
    <li>I learned more about git, I watched some youtube videos and looked at some websites to get a good understanding
        of the underlying processes which allowed me to use git through the terminal/commandline with confidence,
        including using a remote server.</li>
    <li>I learned that the HTML collection objects that are returned by getElementsByClassName() are very useful and
        give you the opportunity to add your own properties for further manipulation. This was very useful on the
        areas page for example. I did this simply by experimenting to see if I could add an area and direction property
        when the navigation arrows are pressed.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h3>
<p>I think that the strongest parts of my work are those that involve changing what is displayed on the page through
    javascript, including the sidebar on the home page, the meets information templated area, the calendar and the
    information on the climbing areas.</p>
<p>These sections work well because the clientside operations in javascript make them respond very quickly and where
    necessary, I created logic to limit the data being displayed. For example on the meets page, I created it so
    that on the initial load of the page, the current month is displayed for meetings from the current day forwards only.
    I also ensured that the user cannot back in to the past before the current time for the meets or the calendar, and
    that both systems stop at the end of their data properly.</p>
<p>I also think using CSS grid to make the layout responsive worked very well. I took great care to ensure that everything
    reduced in size nicely and worked well together, including having the sidebar on the home page not display once the
    viewport gets below 1000px wide.</p>
<p>Using the same dataset for the sidebar and the meets page is also a good feature, meaning only one place needs to
    be updated, reducing the chance for errors.</p>

<h3>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
    another time?</h3>
<p>Although I like the bold and simple graphic style of my website, it could be improved. I feel I still have work to
    do and experience to gain when it comes to layout and design. Another time I would perhaps consult someone with
    graphic design experience to help create a more advanced and modern looking mockup that I could work to as I feel
    my technical skills are there, but my graphic design skills are holding my back so I can feel a little stuck for
    inspiration in that regard.</p>

<h3>What resources were used when creating your work?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I wrote all HTML, CSS, javascript and handlebars code myself.</li>
    <li>As previously mentioned I used the youtube channel, Layout Land to learn about CSS Grid and developer.mozilla.org
        as reference/documentation. I also used this site for a javascript and CSS reference/documentation source.</li>
    <li>I used stack overflow for general debugging help but did not take any code from there.</li>
    <li>I used the course material on handlebars to learn to implement and use that templating engine.</li>
</ul>
